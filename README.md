# TriviaGame aka The Philly 2-Minute Drill

How well does the user know some recent Philadelphia sports trivia? To find out, users take the Philly 2-Minute Drill which is a trivia game consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions with 00:00:20 seconds to respond. 

Answers are shown on buttons which the the user clicks to choose for a particular question. 

The questions and answer choices reset with each previously correct, incorrect, or expired (run out of time on the 00:00:20 seconds) interval.

As the user proceeds, there is a gameBoard which tracks scores for correct, incorrect, and skipped. There are additional buttons to skip questions and reset the game as desired.

Future development plans include the following mods:

(1) greater mobile responsiveness (2) refactorization of the called functions. At this point the called function is on each image's onClick even, thus not fullying utilizing the 'this' alias and assignment of a value from an stored attribute/data-value on the image and lastly at the game's conclusion; (3) there would be two resulting images drawn to the screen depending on the outcome: win or lose. These images have been identified and will be added this week (2019_April07) in time for this submission. If not, shortly thereafer.
